## Unreleased

- Glob built-ins: `glob.match` (wildcards `*`/`**`/`?`, character classes `[...]`/`[!...]`,
  brace alternation `{a,b}` with nesting, escaping, and OPA delimiter semantics — a null
  delimiters argument means "no delimiters", an empty array defaults to `["."]`) and
  `glob.quote_meta`. Matching is by Unicode codepoint; malformed patterns yield undefined.
  Patterns are compiled to an anchored Ruby Regexp under the regex timeout guard. This
  implements correct glob semantics and intentionally does **not** reproduce known bugs in
  OPA's matcher (gobwas/glob): character classes use standard semantics (multiple ranges
  and ranges mixed with literals, e.g. `[A-Za-z]` and `[a0-9]`) rather than gobwas's
  restrictive single-range grammar (gobwas #47), `?` matches non-ASCII characters
  consistently by codepoint even mid-pattern where OPA's `?` still fails on non-ASCII in a
  sequence (gobwas #41), `?`/`[!...]` require exactly one character instead of also
  matching the empty string, and degenerate forms OPA leniently accepts (an unterminated
  `{a,b`, an empty `{}`, and a trailing or lone backslash) yield undefined. Outside these
  corrections, well-formed patterns behave identically to OPA. To stay bounded on
  untrusted input,
  patterns with more than 65,536 delimiters, brace nesting deeper than 100, or a compiled
  regex source over 1 MB yield undefined (DoS guards, analogous to the `numbers.range`
  and `bits.lsh` caps).
- Bitwise built-ins: `bits.and`, `bits.or`, `bits.xor`, `bits.negate`, `bits.lsh`,
  and `bits.rsh`, matching OPA (two's-complement infinite precision; integer-valued
  floats accepted, non-integers and negative shift counts yield undefined). A left
  shift whose result would exceed 2^25 bits (~4 MB) yields undefined rather than
  exhausting memory — a deliberate DoS guard, the only divergence from OPA, affecting
  only `bits.lsh`. Parsing now accepts `and`/`or` as reference segments after a dot so
  `bits.and` / `bits.or` are callable from Rego source.
- String built-ins: `strings.replace_n` (modeled on Go's `strings.Replacer`: keys
  applied in ascending sort order, single pass, replaced text not rescanned,
  earliest-sorted key wins on overlap), and `strings.any_prefix_match` /
  `strings.any_suffix_match` (each argument may be a string, array, or set of strings),
  all matching OPA. `strings.replace_n` scans by Unicode codepoint rather than byte, so
  an empty ("") key against multibyte text inserts only at codepoint boundaries
  (keeping valid UTF-8) instead of OPA's byte-level insertion — the only deviation.
- Crypto built-ins: `crypto.md5`, `crypto.sha1`, and `crypto.sha256` (hex digests of
  the input string's bytes; values from JSON/Rego input are UTF-8, matching OPA). Adds
  `digest` as a runtime dependency.
- String built-ins: `replace` (literal, non-overlapping), `trim_prefix`, `trim_suffix`,
  `strings.reverse`, `strings.count`, and `indexof_n`, matching OPA semantics
  (`indexof_n` is undefined for an empty search).
- Object built-ins: `object.union` (deep merge, second operand wins), `object.union_n`,
  and `object.filter`, matching OPA semantics. `object.filter`/`object.remove` now also
  accept an object as the keys collection (using its keys).
- Encoding built-ins: `json.marshal` (sorted keys, sets as sorted arrays,
  Go-style HTML escaping), `json.unmarshal`, `json.is_valid`, `base64`
  encode/decode/is_valid, `base64url` encode/decode, `hex` encode/decode, and
  `urlquery` encode/decode, matching OPA semantics. Invalid decoder input yields
  an undefined result; non-finite numbers and JSON nested beyond Ruby's default
  depth (a DoS safeguard) also yield undefined rather than raising. Adds `base64`,
  `cgi`, and `json` as runtime dependencies.
- Regex built-ins: `regex.match`, `regex.is_valid`, `regex.split`, and
  `regex.find_n`. `regex.split` matches Go's trailing/zero-width/empty-input
  semantics; invalid patterns yield an undefined result. Patterns compile with
  Ruby's regex engine (Onigmo) rather than Go's RE2, so RE2-incompatible
  constructs (lookahead, backreferences) are treated as valid. A per-match
  timeout (RUBY_REGO_REGEX_TIMEOUT, default 1s) yields an undefined result
  instead of hanging on pathological backtracking.
- Numeric built-ins: `abs`, `round`, `ceil`, `floor`, and `numbers.range`,
  matching OPA semantics (round half away from zero; `numbers.range` accepts
  integer-valued bounds and is undefined for a non-integer bound). Non-finite
  inputs and ranges larger than 1,000,000 elements yield an undefined result
  rather than crashing or exhausting memory.
- Multi-module composition: `Ruby::Rego.compile_modules` / `evaluate_modules` compile
  and evaluate a named set of modules with cross-package references and OPA-style
  same-package merge.
- Documentation refresh, architecture notes, and runnable examples.
- YARD documentation for public APIs.
